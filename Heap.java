Here's a step-by-step guide to Heap Sort in an easy-to-understand way:

Step 1: Understanding the Heap
A heap is a special binary tree-based data structure. There are two types of heaps:

Max-heap: Every parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.
Min-heap: Every parent node is smaller than or equal to its child nodes.
In heap sort, we use a max-heap to sort elements in ascending order.

Step 2: Build the Max-Heap
Convert the unsorted array into a max-heap. In a max-heap:

The largest element is at the root (index 0 of the array).
We will build this max-heap using a process called heapify from the bottom up.
For example, for an array arr[]:

Start from the last non-leaf node (which is at index n/2 - 1 where n is the size of the array).
For each node, ensure it follows the max-heap property:
If the parent node is smaller than any of its children, swap the parent with the largest child.
Continue this process up to the root node.
Step 3: Heapify Process
Heapify is a process to maintain the max-heap property:

Start with a node.
Compare it with its children.
If the node is smaller than the largest child, swap them.
Recursively apply this process down the tree until the heap property is restored.
Step 4: Sorting with the Heap
Now that you have a max-heap:

Swap the root element (maximum element) with the last element in the array. This moves the largest element to its correct position.
Reduce the heap size by 1 (ignore the last element now).
Heapify the new root to restore the max-heap property.
Repeat this process until all elements are sorted.
Step 5: Algorithm in Java
java
Copy code
public class HeapSort {

    // Function to perform heap sort
    public void sort(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length;

        // Step 1: Build max-heap
        for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            heapify(arr, n, i);

        // Step 2: Extract elements one by one from the heap
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            // Move current root (maximum) to end
            int temp = arr[0];
            arr[0] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;

            // Heapify the reduced heap
            heapify(arr, i, 0);
        }
    }

    // To heapify a subtree rooted at node i, with n as size of heap
    void heapify(int arr[], int n, int i) {
        int largest = i; // Initialize largest as root
        int left = 2 * i + 1; // left child
        int right = 2 * i + 2; // right child

        // If left child is larger than root
        if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest])
            largest = left;

        // If right child is larger than largest so far
        if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest])
            largest = right;

        // If largest is not root
        if (largest != i) {
            int swap = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[largest];
            arr[largest] = swap;

            // Recursively heapify the affected subtree
            heapify(arr, n, largest);
        }
    }

    // Driver code
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};
        HeapSort heapSort = new HeapSort();
        heapSort.sort(arr);

        System.out.println("Sorted array is:");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
    }
}
Step 6: Explanation of Code
sort(): This method builds the max-heap from the array, and then extracts the maximum element by repeatedly
  swapping it with the last element and reducing the heap size.
heapify(): This method ensures that the max-heap property is maintained. It checks the parent node with its 
  children and swaps if necessary, then continues down the tree.
Main: This initializes an unsorted array and calls the sort() method to sort the array.
Time Complexity
Building the heap: O(n)
Heapify for sorting: O(log n) for each of the n elements, so the sorting part is O(n log n).
Space Complexity
In-place sorting: No extra space is used except for a few variables, so it's O(1).
Conclusion
Heap sort is efficient with O(n log n) time complexity, but it is not a stable sort. It is commonly used when 
  space is limited as it doesn't require extra memory like other sorts (e.g., merge sort).

whats 2 - 1 here for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            heapify(arr, n, i);

In the line:

java
Copy code
for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    heapify(arr, n, i);
The expression n / 2 - 1 is used to find the index of the last non-leaf node in a binary tree representation of the array. Here's why:

1. Array Representation of Binary Tree
In a heap (binary tree), if an element is at index i, then:
Left child is at index 2i + 1
Right child is at index 2i + 2
Leaf nodes in a heap are the nodes that do not have children, and in a complete binary tree, all leaf nodes are in the second half of the array.
2. Why n / 2 - 1?
The total number of elements in the array is n.
The non-leaf nodes are the nodes that have children, and all of them are in the first half of the array.
The last non-leaf node is the parent of the last leaf node.
The last leaf node is at index n - 1.
Its parent is at index (n - 1) / 2, which simplifies to n / 2 - 1.
Thus, n / 2 - 1 gives the index of the last non-leaf node from which you start heapifying the array.
  This ensures that you are heapifying the array from the bottom-up, which is more efficient.
