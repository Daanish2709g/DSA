/*Hashing is a technique used in data structures that efficiently stores and retrieves data in a way
that allows for quick access.Hashing is a data structure technique that maps data 
to fixed-size values, or hashes, to make data easier to find and access: 

The great thing about hashing is, we can achieve all three operations
(search, insert and delete) in O(1) time on average.

How it works
A hash function maps a key or string of characters to a hash value, which is then used as an 
index to access data in a hash table. 
  
Why it's useful
Hashing is a computationally and storage-efficient way to access data. It's used in many 
applications, including data indexing and retrieval, digital signatures, cybersecurity, 
and cryptography.
  
Examples
This method is commonly used in databases, caching systems, and various programming applications 
to optimize search and retrieval operations.

Hashing is used in universities to assign students unique roll numbers, 
and in libraries to assign books unique numbers.*/
